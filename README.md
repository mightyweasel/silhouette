A simple heatmap to develop a basic organizational personality profile

## Experimental

This is just a simple test to create a basic d3 heatmap and aligning it with metrics 
that can help us understand the organizational personality profile (what things are common,
what is the core focus, where do folks think it is)

Expect changes, this is not a product. Just a proof of concept.
